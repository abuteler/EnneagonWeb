## Credits
This project:
- was designed using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/).
- was built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
- uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
- uses [Apollo GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com/) for the querying and mutation of data, and I followed [Jareer Zeenam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jareer-zeenam/)'s [guide](https://medium.com/@jareerzeenam/implementing-graphql-and-apollo-server-with-next-js-13-4-a-simple-guide-app-directory-77e38eb697e3) for help with its integration with NextJS.
